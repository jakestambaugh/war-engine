# War

A "game as a service" that can be used to track basic stuff.

For now, it's just the game of war.

Eventually, you will be able to customize the deck of 26 cards that you bring to
the war.

## Rules

Each player starts the game with 26 cards

At the start of the turn, both players flip the top card of their deck.

The player with the greater value card wins, adding both cards to their discard
pile. 

If the two card values are equal, then a war happens.
- each player places the next three cards face down
- each player flips the following card and compares the values.
    - If equal, another war occurs
    - If one is greater, that player wins all of the cards currently contested

The game ends when all cards have been claimed. (Or 5 shuffles, since this might get boring)
